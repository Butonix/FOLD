            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p>Thanks for using FOLD! Before you start using the service, we want to make you aware of your rights as a user and some of our policies. These policies will likely evolve and change as FOLD grows. We welcome any feedback you may have, and the team can be reached at <a class="green" href="mailto:fold@media.mit.edu">fold@media.mit.edu.</a> These terms are effective March 17th, 2014.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Some key words:</h2>
            <p><b>“Narrative cards”</b>: Narrative cards form the backbone of a FOLD story. A row of context cards is associated with individual narrative cards.</p>
            <p><b>“Context Cards”</b>: Context cards surround narrative cards. They can be explored with the left and right arrows, or linked directly to words and phrases in a narrative card. Context cards bring in multimedia elements, including videos, maps, photos, gifs, tweets, interactive data visualizations, text, and more.</p>
            <p><b>“Stories”</b>: A story is your collection of narrative and context cards.</p>
            <p><b>“Remixing”</b>: Any context card can be remixed by another author. If it is remixed, the new card will link back to the original story and provide attribution to the author who first created it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>By using this software and joining the FOLD community, you agree to the following terms:</h2>
            <p>1. <b>Your content</b>: You own the rights to all narrative cards you write or publish on FOLD. You may delete your stories at any time. However, by posting a story you agree to allow us to store, display, publicize, and distribute it. We will never sell your content to third parties. We don’t screen content but we reserve the right to remove any content you post to FOLD. You are responsible for the content you post and assume all risks associated with it. By posting, you agree that you have the necessary rights to post that content.</p>
            <p>2. <b>Code of conduct</b>: We want FOLD to be a vibrant and respectful community. You may not threaten other users with violence or otherwise harass them, post hateful slurs, post spam, engage in fraud, or promote self harm. If you notice any violations of this code of conduct on FOLD, you may contact us by e-mail and we will attempt to resolve the issue. If you engage in any of these behaviors, we reserve the right to terminate your account.</p>
            <p>3. <b>Remixing</b>: By creating context cards, you agree to let them be used by other authors in their stories. Any context cards you produce that are remixed by another author will attribute you and link back to your story. You can not permanently delete these cards once they have been used in another author’s story, though you may decide to remove any attribution linking the card to you.</p>
            <p>4. <b>Changes to terms</b>: We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. We will keep an up-to-date version of the terms on the “About” page of our site. If the changes to the terms are substantive, we will e-mail all users to alert them and they may delete their accounts if they do not agree to the changes.</p>
